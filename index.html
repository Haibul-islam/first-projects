            <p class="go" >my country although there are limitation for women to progress in their job, and universities provide more capacity for boys than girls, there are lots of girls who like to study in STEM. Actually in my country clever students just want to study engineering or medicine, no matter they are girl or boy. One of th eve most famous women who studiedmathematics in my country is Maryam MirzaKhani, who won the Fields medal which we know Nobel prize in mathematics. I think the biggest barrier for women to be successful in their job or study is housework  </p>
